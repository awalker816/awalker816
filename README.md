<h1>👩🏾‍💻 About Me</h1>
    
  Hi, I'm April Walker -- a Cybersecurity & Information Assurance student at Western Governors University, proudly CompTIA A+, Network+, and Security+ certified. 🚀
    
  I'm passionate about network security, incident response, and threat detection. Through hands-on labs, virtual environments and platforms like Wireshark, VirtualBox, and TryHackMe, I'm sharpening my skills in: 

🔹 Network configuration & troubleshooting

🔹 Subnetting & secure network design

🔹 Security monitoring & incident response

🔹 IDS/IPS and segmentation labs

💼 Professional Edge: At Amazon, I’ve built a foundation in operational excellence—maintaining Top 3%+ quality metrics, mentoring peers, and working with IoT/robotic systems to keep performance and security top-tier.

🎯 Career Goal: Becoming a Threat Detection Security Engineer, where I can merge technical expertise, resilience, and a passion for protecting systems and data.

✨ Fun Fact: I’m serious about continuous learning and growth in cybersecurity.
