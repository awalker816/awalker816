<h1>👩🏾‍💻 About Me</h1>
    
  Hi, I'm April Walker -- a Cybersecurity & Information Assurance student at Western Governors University, proudly CompTIA CySA+, Security+, Network+, and A+ certified. 🚀
    
  I’m passionate about threat detection, incident response, and security monitoring. Through hands-on labs, virtual environments, and platforms like Wireshark, VirtualBox, and TryHackMe, I’m strengthening my skills in:: 

🔹 Network configuration & troubleshooting

🔹 Subnetting & secure network design

🔹 Security monitoring, alert triage, and incident response

🔹 IDS/IPS detection engineering, rule tuning, and network segmentation labs

💼 Professional Edge: At Amazon, I’ve built a foundation in operational excellence—maintaining Top 3%+ quality metrics, mentoring peers, and working with IoT/robotic systems to keep performance and security top-tier.

🎯 Career Goal: Becoming a Threat Detection Security Engineer, where I can merge technical expertise, resilience, and a passion for protecting systems and data.

✨ Fun Fact: I’m serious about continuous learning and growth in cybersecurity.
